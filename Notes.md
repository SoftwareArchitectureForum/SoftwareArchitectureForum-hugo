The "free time" slots can be used for skiing, and allow you to purchase
a 1/2 day afternoon pass. You may also organize alternative activities
during the mid-day break. Skiing is completely optional, and is your
responsibility, although groups are likely to form. See
[www.skicb.com](http://www.skicb.com/) for more information.
