We hold the event in town, and free buses run up to the ski mountain
every 15 minutes.

We hold the event in downtown Crested Butte -- note that you should try to
stay downtown and not on the mountain, so you can just walk everywhere.

Internet is available in the conference location and at several locations
within easy walking distance of the conference location.
