the continental divide. It is known for its skiing in the winter and
hiking and mountain biking in the summer.

Although free buses run up to the ski mountain every 15 minutes (so you can
find lodging there), we hold the event in downtown Crested Butte. People
generally have a better time staying downtown (*The Town of Crested Butte*) and
not on the mountain (*The Town of MOUNT Crested Butte*). This way, you can just
walk everywhere.

Internet is available in the conference location and at several locations
within easy walking distance of the conference location.
