### Although lodging is available in *Mount* Crested Butte, it is 3 miles away (there is a free bus). You'll usually have the best experience if you find lodging in *The Town of Crested Butte*.

There is also a [hostel](http://www.cbhostel.com/), and numerous AirB&B's and VRBO-style
spaces available.

Most lodgings provide Internet access but you should ask to make sure. The
local coffee shops all have Internet access and generally welcome workers.

Group Houses
------------

One of the most popular things to do for conferences is to rent houses
together. This might or might not be cheaper, but it's generally more fun and
a nicer experience. It also adds an additional workspace for the retreat.

Make sure you add yourself to the Slack group for the conference, so you can
make arrangements with other attendees to rent houses. Usually one person
finds the house, and then others come and fill it up.

if you're looking for a house.

Other Lodging
-------------

There are many AirBnB locations available; again, try for *Crested Butte*, not
*Mount Crested Butte*.

Crested Butte has a number of hotels, varying from OK to nice, none of which
are chains. If you're in a hurry you can just call the Crested Butte Chamber of
Commerce at (800) 545-4505 and they will help you make a reservation. Remember
to ask for a reservation *in the town of Crested Butte*, and not on the
mountain, in order to be close to the conference location. However, in the
Summer there are always more rooms available on the mountain than in town, and
the bus runs every 15 minutes between the mountain and town.

If you're on a budget, try the [hostel](http://cbhostel.com/) or ask the
Chamber of Commerce about camping.
