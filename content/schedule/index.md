**Pre-conference**: If you arrive early, post something on Twist. If I or others
are around and available, we might be able to come out for meals or other
activities.

***********************************

Sunday 6:00pm
-------------

Welcome Potluck Barbeque at Bruce's House (107 WhiteRock). Bring something
to grill, cook, or share.

Go to the corner of First and WhiteRock, and you'll see a building of four
townhomes with solar panels on the room. My unit is the furthest away from
the corner, and you'll see a little white cargo trailer in front. I usually
have colorful lights on, as well.
