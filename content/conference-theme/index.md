**Potential Topics:**

-   Using new tools to solve old problems
-   Designing for simplicity: understandable is maintainable
-   Reconsidering agile timeboxing
-   Exploring the potential of cross-language development
-   Discovering ineffective patterns
-   Breaking out of our mental and cultural chains
-   Accepting that big shifts might take time
-   Can we take the interview out of the job interview?
-   Re-envisioning how we recruit, onboard, and build teams
-   And lots more
-   Plus anything else anyone wants to talk about, of course
-   And our business track

Although the theme sets the general tone of the conference, it doesn't
preclude session topics that might be considered "off theme." The goal
of the theme is to stimulate ideas, not to prevent discussion.

Wednesday Hackathon
-------------------

Hackathons typically explore new technologies or even create new product
prototypes. Past hackathons have ranged from hardware projects to the
exploration of new languages, and some have focused on a particular product or
technology. All you need is a group that wants to explore a topic.

Hackathons take place in either the conference venue or the various houses
that are rented by groups in town. The evening of the hackathon, results are
presented in the *Hackathon Showcase Lightning Talks*.
